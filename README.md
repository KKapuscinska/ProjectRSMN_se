Welcome to the "ProjectRSMN" repository! This project aims to create and execute a set of automated tests for the **[Rossmann](https://www.rossmann.pl)** web application. 
The main goal of this project is to improve my proficiency in test automation by utilizing the powerful **Selenium** testing framework.
